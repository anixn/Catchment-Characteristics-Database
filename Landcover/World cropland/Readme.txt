Global Agricultural Lands in 2000

DESCRIPTION
This archive contains the Global Agricultural Lands dataset, created by Navin Ramankutty et al. (2008). Documentation for data is available at these web sites:
http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/es/aglands.html

Updates and corrections may still be made. If you should discover any problems or errors, please inform us at: ciesin.info@ciesin.columbia.edu

The archive contains the global and continental cropland and pasture grids. The grids are available as compressed geotiffs. To access the grids the contents of the zipfiles must be extracted into a single folder. 

DOWNLOADING DATA
The data can be downloaded via the World Wide Web at http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/es/aglands.html. 

Downloaded files need to be uncompressed using either WinZip (Windows file compression utility) or similar applications before they could be accessed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Users should expect some increase in the size of downloaded data after decompression. 

DATA GRID VALUES
The downloaded grid values represent the proportion of pixel are that is either under cropland or pasture. The grid values range between 0 and 1. 0 means zero percent of pixel area under cropland or pasture present and 1 - 100% of the pixel area under cropland or pasture.
